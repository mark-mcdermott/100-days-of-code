[problem](https://github.com/mark-mcdermott/100-days-of-code/blob/master/neetcode-courses/01-algos-data-structs-beginners/06-doubly-linked-lists/01-design-linked-list--leetcode-num-707--02-03-2025.test.js) [data structure](https://github.com/mark-mcdermott/100-days-of-code/blob/master/neetcode-courses/01-algos-data-structs-beginners/06-doubly-linked-lists/DoublyLinkedList.js) [vitests](https://github.com/mark-mcdermott/100-days-of-code/blob/master/neetcode-courses/01-algos-data-structs-beginners/06-doubly-linked-lists/DoublyLinkedList.test.js)

### R1D7
Eight days later... feeling mostly better finally and trying to get back into my flow.
Finished doubly linked list problem 2 (browser history) from neetcode Beginner DSA course. More vitest TDD. tinyurl.com/2xb3e7zt

### R1D8
Finished answer to Neetcode Beginner DSA course Queues problem 1 (Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch). tinyurl.com/53enky6h
Overcomplicated it, didn't realize leetcode automatically imports data structure classes. I'll go through the proper answer some more tomorrow.

### R1D9
Worked through two correct answers to "number of students unable to eat lunch" problem. First one is O(n^2), second is O(n). tinyurl.com/mtyhsarx

### R1D10
Started second queue problem. Didn't get too far on it, yet. tinyurl.com/3hv23bdu

### R1D11
Was sick again for a few days. But tonight finished neetcode two queue stack problem. tinyurl.com/3hv23bdu
