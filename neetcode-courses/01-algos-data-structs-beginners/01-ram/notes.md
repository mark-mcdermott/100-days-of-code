# RAM

## Definition
Ram is volitile storage

## Details
- "Random Access Memory" - "we can access any random address instantly"
- RAM can store advanced structures
- RAM measured in bytes
  - byte is 8 bits
  - a bit is a "position that can store a digit" (only 0 or 1)  
- RAM has values/addresses ($0, $4, $8...)
- Arrays are always contiguous in RAM

## Storage
- integers are commonly stored in 4 bytes
  - so 32 bit integer is common
  - 32 bit signed integer can be approx -2B to 2B
  - 32 bit unsigned integer can be 0 to approx 4B
- alpha characters (ASCII) take 1 byte of space each
